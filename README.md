## ATM Machine - Ava Tunti
# Description:
This program allows you to deposit or withdraw money and see the live changes in your account balance. 

# Running Instructions:
Simply go to the link [ATM Machine](https://ava-tunti.github.io/atm/standalone.html) and click the dropdown to select an option. Then, withdraw or deposit money as you please!

# Improvements Made:
Improvements I made include making the CSS styles nicer to make the app look more proffesional, adding a dropdown feature that includes a null option, and the app will also alert you if you don't have enough funds to withdraw money from your account!
